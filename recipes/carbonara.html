        <h3>The Trick to Good Carbonara</h3>
        <p>Stirring the egg mixture quickly into the pasta which should be hot enough to "cook" the egg
            to make a sauce but not so hot as to make it curdle.
            Getting carbonara just right can take some practice so don't despair if your 
            carbonara sauce is a little lumpy the first time you make it.
            Some people add cream to their carbonara. It's not traditional, but you can certainly do this,
            and make an even creamier sauce for the pasta.
            Personally, I think it's rich enough without it. Enjoy!</p>
